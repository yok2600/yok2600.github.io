Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 
and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I followed this
[article](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) which explains exactly how to do it.
